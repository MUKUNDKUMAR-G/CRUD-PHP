Follow these steps to run this application locally:

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- A web server (e.g., **XAMPP**, **WAMP**, or **LAMP**)
- PHP (version 7.4 or higher recommended)
- MySQL

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd php-crud-application
```

### 3️⃣ Set Up the Database

- Create a MySQL database named `crud_app`.
- Use the following SQL schema to create the required table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE `curd_operation` (
      `ID` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      `USERNAME` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      `PHONE NO` VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
      `EMAIL` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      `PLACE` VARCHAR(100),
      PRIMARY KEY (`ID`)
  );
  ```

### 4️⃣ Configure the Database Connection

Update the `includes/connection.php` file with your database credentials:

```php
$host = 'localhost';
$username = 'root';
$password = '';
$database = 'crud_app';
$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database);
```

### 5️⃣ Start the Server
